# Manager of Finance

Finance Manager is a personal finance app built with Python. It helps users manage their income, expenses, and budgets in a safe way. To protect sensitive data, users can register and log in using bcrypt password hashing. Users can view financial insights through monthly and annual reports, and they can categorize transactions. They can also add, edit, and delete transactions. The app allows users to set category limits with a budget module. This module sends alerts when users reach or exceed 90% of their budget. To prevent data loss, the system offers backup and restore features. Finance Manager is reliable and user-friendly due to its modular structure, clear code, and thorough unit tests.
